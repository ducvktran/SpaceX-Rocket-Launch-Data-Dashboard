# SpaceX-Rocket-Launch-Data-Dashboard
This notebook contains the Python code to make a dashboard for a dataset on SpaceX rocket launches, which was done as part of the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. Since GitHub doesn't support HTML outputs, the dashboard is not shown here.
